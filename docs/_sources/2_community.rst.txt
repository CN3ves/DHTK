We are proud to say that the DHTK community is growing continuously.
Being created by the researchers of the "Informatique pour les Sciences Humaines" of the University of Lausanne,
the project has seen an increased interest from both the teachers of other sections and the students,
both from Bachelor and Master programs. DHTK was also presented at the Second Workshop on Humanities in
the Semantic Web (WHiSeII) co-located with 16th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2017),
held in Vienna, Austria in 2017. Multiple visitors of the workshop have expressed interest in DHTK and
the project was well received. As such, people from different walks of life from different parts of the
world have already become a part of our community. You can do so too by contributing to this open source
project.
