Installation
============

In order to install DHTK, `Python 3.x <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ is required.
Note that when using a local endpoint, `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ application is required
as DHTK uses a Fuseki container as endpoint.

There are two ways to get DHTK python module:

**1)** Download the `DHTK source code <https://gitlab.com/dhtk/dhtk/tree/master>`_ in your preferred format,
extract the DHTK files and access them via console.

::

    $ cd dhtk
    $ python setup.py

**2)** Use package installer for Python (pip):

::

    $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/dhtk/dhtk.git
