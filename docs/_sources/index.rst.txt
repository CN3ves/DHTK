A tool for processing digital text in different formats and languages
#####################################################################

In recent years, Digital Humanities have received a particular attention in both the humanities and
computer science communities.

Scholars involved in Digital Humanities research often need a certain number of datasets concerning cultural data.
The Internet is a great source for this kind of information and repositories such as Project Gutenberg, Europeana,
Archive.org, *et similia*, are great resources.

Although automatic tools for text or image analysis have already been created for
some time, many of these tools have technical difficulties or scientific objectives that do not properly
fit the needs of the humanities community. These resources are organized and structured in
different ways and often incompatible, having different APIs and different metadata, which make these repositories
difficult to exploit. Finding resources, checking metadata and finally cleaning data, can be a long and tedious process.

By introducing the Digital Humanities Tool Kit (DHTK), we present a new python library whose scope is to overcome these
limits by providing a fast and intuitive tool for a large-scale study of large literary databases by leveraging
on some well-known semantic knowledge resources, supporting and simplifying research in Digital Humanities.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


- What is DHTK?

DHTK stands for Digital Humanities ToolKit.
Its purpose is to connect two very different disciplines: Humanities and Computer Sciences.
At the moment, DHTK focuses on interacting with the Gutenberg database in tandem with DBpedia to provide access to
literary works and their associated metadata in an easy and intuitive way. However, being modular, we expect DHTK
functionalities to quickly grow and support different areas of research.


- How do I use DHTK?

You can find information on how to install DHTK as well as the getting started guide on the
`Get Started <./intro.html>`_ page.


- I would like to have access to some of more technical information related to DHTK

Complete technical information is available in the `DHTK Architecture <./architecture.html>`_ page,
which contains further links to more detailed information about DHTK internal structure.


- I want to contribute to DHTK, how can I contact you?

Thank you for your interesting in joining our effort. If you are interested in developing or improving DHTK
you can find instructions and contact form on the `Community <./community.html>`_ page.
