Scholars involved in Digital Humanities research often need a certain number of datasets concerning cultural data.
The Internet is a great source for this kind of information and repositories such as Project Gutenberg, Europeana, Archive.org, *et similia*, are great resources.
Unfortunately, these resources are organized and structured in different ways and often incompatible, having different APIs and different metadata, which make these repositories difficult to exploit.

Finding resources, checking metadata and finally cleaning data, can be a long and tedious process.
DHTK is a project aimed at creating a library with the intent to help researchers in Digital Humanities finding data and metadata in a simple way,
proposing a unified API to accomplish those tasks and thus supporting and simplifying research in Digital Humanities.
