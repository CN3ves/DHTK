Start DHTK
==========

Loading DHTK
------------

As a Python module, DHTK can be accessed from any Python console or environment
by `importing <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html?highlight=import>`_
it as normally.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_start.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 5-13

Setting up Configurations
-------------------------

The first step to use DHTK is to set the configurations to use by calling
**dhtk.start()**

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_start.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 17

This function instantiates DHTK's settings manager class, which searches for the user's saved
settings. It automatically prints all current settings for the user's information.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_start.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 21-30
    :emphasize-lines: 5

DHTK contains a number of options to help users start up faster and automatically, most of which
have a default value. The settings to pay more attention to are the following:

* *[user]*: By default, DHTK tries to access the system's information to identify the user. It is possible to change this default user name, which may be particularly relevant when working on shared machines.

* *[wd]*: DHTK uses the user' home directory to set up its working directory. This can be modified if another directory would be more suitable.

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><b><i>!!!</i></b></summary>

.. note:: DHTK uses both *wd* and *user* to search for saved settings. If different values are passed to DHTK, the user's previous settings may not be properly acessible.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

* *[endpoint]*: DHTK uses a local Fuseki server as its default SPARQL endpoint for querying pre-processed datasets. To use a remote (on-line) endpoint, it can be done by adding the URL (link) to the remote endpoint.

* *[dataset]*: DHTK is a modular package to which extensions can be easily added. This setting determines which of the available extension modules DHTK should load.

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><b><i>!!!</i></b></summary>

.. note:: As illustrated above, dataset does not have a default value and must be set **the first time** a user runs DHTK.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

.. seealso:: `Start function <14_api.html#start>`_

Modifying configurations
------------------------

Configurations can be *set directly* by passing their values as keyword arguments to the dhtk.start() function.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_start.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 34-47

.. role:: python(code)
   :language: python

Alternatively, all settings can be *modified* using Python's dot notation to access the configuration
object's attributes. For example, updating the user name is as simple as :python:`configs.user = "egloff"`

DHTK extensions
===============

Using the settings, DHTK will determine which SPARQL endpoint to connect and which
extension module to load. These two functionalities
are all handled by the function **dhtk.get_module()**.

Currently, DHTK includes the following extensions:

* `Project Gutenberg <#gutenberg>`_
* `Auchinkleck manuscript <#auchinleck>`_

.. seealso:: `get_module() function <14_api.html#get_module>`_


Gutenberg
---------

DHTK's Gutenberg extension dataset allows the user to easily query `Gutenberg.org <http://gutenberg.org/>`_
for **books, authors, bookshelves and subjects**, retrieving all the available information as a DHTK Corpus.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 6-15

DHTK provides a simple dictionary-like syntax to search Guntenberg's dataset using the method
**.get()**. This method allows the user to easily query the entire dataset using a single interface
with only 3 keyword arguments:

* [*what*] to search for.
* [*name*] of what is being searched. If no name is provided, all available options are retrieved.
* [*add*] to corpus or just search results?

.. seealso:: `Module.get() <./142_ext.html#AbstractExtension.get>`_

Exploring Data
**************

To **search** Gutenberg's data, set *add=False*. For such queries, DHTK Gutenberg's module
returns a dictionary of books or authors matching the query.

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><b><i>!!!</i></b></summary>

.. note:: *add=False* is the default value, so this argument can be simply ignored by the user in such cases.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

.. rubric:: **Searching for a bookshelf**

To check which `bookshelves <http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/>`_
are available in DHTK's Gutenberg, set *what="shelf"* and *name="all"*.

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><b><i>!!!</i></b></summary>

.. note::  *name="all"* is the default value, so this argument may be simply ignored by the user.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 18-24

To search for books available for a bookshelf, the name, or part of the name, of an available bookshelf is passed to the *name*
argument. For example, to search all books in "Science Fiction" bookshelves:

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 27-28

The list of bookshelves matching the query are stored as the dictionary keys for easy access:

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 30-33

The information for individual bookshelves can be easily retrieved using the dictionary key.
This strutcture makes it easy to perform all types of regular Python operations.
For example, to identify all books that are simultaneously found on the bookshelves "Precursors of Science Fiction"
and "Science Fiction by Women":

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 35-38

.. rubric:: **Searching for a subject**

Gutenberg `subjects <http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/subjects/search/>`_ can be searched using *what="subject"*.
Subject names are structured hierarchically, making it possible to define the granularity of such queries.
Each hierarchy is separated by \-\- *(e.g. Subject \-\- Sub-subject \-\- Sub-sub-subject)*

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 41-53

.. rubric:: **Searching for a book**

Gutenberg books can be searched using the *what="book"* argument. This will return a dictionary of
books containing the text passed as *name*. To avoid long names, the dictionary keys returned are
truncated at 20 characters.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 56-59

.. rubric:: **Searching for an author**

Gutenberg books can be searched using the *what="author"* argument.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 62-67
    :emphasize-lines: 6

Check metadata
**************

DHTK Guntenberg's module uses books and authors objects to store all the relevant information retrieved.
These objects can be accessed directly from the dictionaries obtained while searching as described above.

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><b><i>!!!</i></b></summary>

.. note:: The book and author objects are not returned when searching for bookshelves and subjects. These queries are considered more exploratory and instantiating all objects would be less efficient in respect to both performance and memory.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

.. rubric:: **Get book information**

Retrieving metadata is simple as all Gutenberg objects have the **.print_info()** method:

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 70-112
    :emphasize-lines: 6

.. rubric:: **Get author information**

Author objects are retrieved with author searches as described above. However, book objects also
contain the author information as attribute. Because of this, there are two ways to access an author object:

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 115-120

Accessing the author's information can be done as easily as for books, using the **.print_info()** method:

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 122-142
    :emphasize-lines: 15

.. rubric:: **Get book text**

The original text for a Gutenberg book can also be accessed if required, using the GutenbergBook method
**.original_text()**.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 145-152

.. seealso:: `GutenbergBook <./142_ext.html#gutenbergbook>`_ and `GutenbergAuthor <./142_ext.html#gutenbergauthor>`_ classes

Saving results
**************

To add the retrieved book to a DHTK Corpus use *add=True*. A list of GutenbergBook objects
is created containing all the textual data and metadata retrieved from
`Guntenberg.org <http://www.gutenberg.org/>`_.

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><b><i>!!!</i></b></summary>

.. note:: Each query that uses *add=True* will add the resulting books to the same module object. This means that a new module needs to be instantiated with **.get_module()** function for each different corpus

.. raw:: html

   </details>


.. rubric:: **Make a Corpus**

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 155-174

.. rubric:: **Change Corpus' description**

Before saving the Corpus to disk, it is important to review the Corpus descriptions, particularly the corpus name,
which is used as the directory where the books will be stored. This can be done simply by passing the
*name* and *description* arguments to the **.corpus()** method used above.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 176-192

.. rubric:: **Save Corpus**

When all the information as been added to a corpus, it can be easily saved to disk using the
**.save()** method.

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/12_guide_gutenberg.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 194-200

.. seealso:: `GutenbergCorpus <./142_ext.html#gutenbergcorpus>`_
