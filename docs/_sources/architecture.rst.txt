============
Architecture
============
DHTK is divided in three parts: the core modules, the extension modules and
the processing modules as described below.


Core Modules
------------

The core modules define DHTK configurations, logging and functionality loading,
providing the initial framework underlying the modularisation of DHTK.
For more information, see `Core API reference <./api.html>`_

Extension modules
-----------------

The extension modules are modules that add functionalities for querying and searching
specific databases or data types. It includes the `blueprint <./extensions#blueprint>`_ to help with development and contribution from the
Digital Humanities' `community <./community>`_, allowing easy integration of new modules and
continuous growth to better suit the different DHTK users.

The current version focuses on textual resources such as
`Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`_ and `Auchinkleck manuscript <https://auchinleck.nls.uk/>`_,
because of its immediate relevance in the Humanities community and the
lack of automatic tools available in order to exploit these specific resources.

For more information, see `Extensions API reference <./extensions.html>`_

Processing modules
------------------

One of the most important aspects for a humanist is not just the availability
of texts but also the metadata coming with texts. Unfortunately, not all
repositories have complete. For example, Project Gutenberg does not store the original
publishing date of its books, which can represent a problem if a corpus needs be
delimited to a decade of published literature. Resources like DBpedia, thanks to its encyclopaedic
nature, helps to rethink these elements.

In addition, many statistical, classification
and predictive have been recently developed they can help the researcher to further
explore and generate new insight from the relevant dataset.

Leveraging the power of cutting-edge
`Linked Open Data <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data>`_ and
`machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_ technologies
(*e.g* `NLP <vhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`_),
DHTK aims to make these tools easily accessible to the Humanities scholar soon.
