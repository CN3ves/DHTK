============
Installation
============

In order to install DHTK, `Python 3.x <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ is required.
Note that when using a local triplestore, `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ application is required
as DHTK uses a Fuseki container as endpoint.

There are two main ways to get DHTK python module:

1) Download the `DHTK source code <https://gitlab.com/dhtk/dhtk/tree/master>`_ in your preferred format,
extract the DHTK files and access them via console.

::
    $ cd dhtk
    $ python setup.py


2) or use pip:

::
    $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/dhtk/dhtk.git


==========
How to use
==========
DHTK is a module for Python3.x. As such, it is accessible using any Python console or environment.
DHTK access occurs in four steps:

1) Importing DHTK module

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/usage.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 3-11
    :emphasize-lines: 1

2) Define DHTK settings

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/usage.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 12-21
    :emphasize-lines: 1

3) Connect to a `SPARQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL>`_ endpoint
4) Load and use a custom DHTK extension

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/usage.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 22-28
    :emphasize-lines: 1


============
Architecture
============
DHTK is divided in two parts: the core modules and the extension modules.
A third part, the processing modules, will be added in later version to leverage
computational methods for automated analyses and process of DHTK data and metadata
(*e.g.* natural language processing of texts)


Core Modules
------------

The core modules determine DHTK configurations, logging and query to the data and metadata,
providing the initial framework to work with the extended functionality modules.
These modules include the `settings <../api#settings>`_,
`client <../api#client>`_, `dataset <../api#dataset>`_
and `helpers <../api#helpers>`_ modules.


Extension modules
-----------------

The extension modules are modules tailored for querying and searching specific databases or
data type, adding functionalities better suited for the different DHTK users. It includes the
`blueprint <../extensions#blueprint>`_ to help with development and contribution from the
Digital Humanities' `community <../community>`_

The current version focuses on textual resources such as
`Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`_ and `Auchinkleck manuscript <https://auchinleck.nls.uk/>`_,
because of its immediate relevance in the Humanities community and the
lack of automatic tools available in order to exploit these specific resources.


Processing modules
------------------

One of the most important aspects for a humanist is not just the availability
of texts but also the metadata coming with texts. Unfortunately, not all
repositories have complete. For example, Project Gutenberg does not store the original
publishing date of its books, which can represent a problem if a corpus needs be
delimited to a decade of published literature. DBpedia, thanks to its encyclopaedic
nature, helps to rethink these elements.

In addition, many statistical, classification
and predictive have been recently developed they can help the researcher to further
explore and generate new insight from the relevant dataset.

Leveraging the power of cutting-edge
`Linked Open Data <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data>`_ and
`machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_ technologies
(*e.g* `NLP <vhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`_),
DHTK aims to make these tools easily accessible to the Humanities scholar soon.
