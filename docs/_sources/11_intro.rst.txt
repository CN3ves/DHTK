Installation
============

.. rubric:: **Install Python**

As DHTK is a Python modules, make sure you have Python installed on your system.
You can do this in three different ways:

1) Manually search the common locations where your system saves applications.
2) You can use the search file options from you system to find the Python application
3) You can type `python --version` on your command line or powershell (Windows)

If you don't have Python 3 installs, please `download it <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and
follow the instructions. We recommend using the most up-to-date Python 3 version,
but DHTK is compatible with at least Python 3.5+.

.. rubric:: **Install Docker**

In addition to Python 3, you are likely to use a local SPARQL endpoint when using
DHTK to search pre-processed data. This requires setting up a Fuseki server container
on the Docker application. To do so, you will need to
`download Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ before running DHTK.

.. note:: DHTK may attempt to install docker (macOS systems only) and set up all required containers and volumes.

.. rubric:: **Install DHTK**

DHTK can be installed as a regular python modules, using the
package installer for Python (pip):

::

    $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/dhtk/dhtk.git

Alternatively, you may download the `DHTK source code <https://gitlab.com/dhtk/dhtk/tree/master>`_ in your
preferred format. Once you extract the DHTK files from the archive, you can access them via command line
(or powershell).

::

    $ cd dhtk
    $ python setup.py


Using Gutenberg.org
===================

To start exploring DHTK's `Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`_ dataset,
run:

.. literalinclude:: ./examples/11_quick_gutenberg.py
    :language: python

.. note:: DHTK runs a number of system check to try to guarantee if can run without any problem. If this is the first time you're running it, keep in mind that it may take considerable time to complete the the full set.
