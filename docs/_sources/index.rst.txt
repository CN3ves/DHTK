Welcome to DHTK's documentation!
################################

In recent years, the digital humanities have received particular attention from both the humanities community
and from computer science. Scholars working in Digital Humanities research often need to access
to a range of data regarding cultural data.

The Internet is a great source for searching and retrieving this type of information, and archives
such as Project Gutenberg, Europeana, Archive.org, *and similia*, provide many datasets relevant to the research scientists. However, many of these resources are organized and structured in different ways and are
often incompatible, having different APIs and different metadata structures, which make these repositories
difficult to exploit.

In addition, a number of powerful automated methods for analyzing text, sound, and images have been developed,
but these tools are technically difficult or do not adequately fit the needs of the humanities community.

As a result, finding resources, checking metadata, and finally processing cultural data and metadata,
can be a long, tedious, and complex process.

By introducing the Digital Humanities Tool Kit (DHTK), we propose a new python library whose purpose is to
overcome these limitations by providing an intuitive tool for large-scale study of large cultural databases,
exploiting state-of-the-art computational methods to support and simplify research in the Digital Humanities.
